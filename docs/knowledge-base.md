## 3. Technical Analysis 📈

### 3.1 Price Action Analysis 📊
- **Definition**:  
  The study of pure price movements on charts, focusing on candlestick patterns, trend structure, and price levels without additional indicators.

- **Key Components**:
  1. Trend Structure:
     - Higher highs/lows in uptrends
     - Lower highs/lows in downtrends
     - Sideways consolidation patterns
  2. Candlestick Patterns:
     - Bullish/bearish engulfing
     - Doji formations
     - Pin bars at key levels

**Example**:
A bullish engulfing pattern forms at $1,900 support after a downtrend. The next candle opens at $1,905 and closes at $1,915, suggesting trend reversal. Subsequent trading confirms uptrend with higher lows at $1,908 and $1,912.

### 3.2 Technical Indicators 📉
- **Definition**:  
  Mathematical calculations based on price and/or volume that help identify market conditions, trends, and potential reversals.

#### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- **Technical Details**:
  - Calculation Period: Typically 14 periods
  - Overbought Level: 70
  - Oversold Level: 30

**Example**:
Gold RSI drops to 25 (oversold) at $1,890 support level. Price forms a bullish divergence (lower price, higher RSI), suggesting potential reversal. Entry at $1,895 with stop below $1,885 targets $1,915 resistance.

### 3.3 ICT Concepts 🎯

#### Liquidity Sweeps 💫
- **Definition**:  
  Strategic price movements designed to trigger stop-loss orders above significant highs or below significant lows. These moves create liquidity for larger players to enter or exit positions.

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Rapid price spikes beyond key levels
  - Sharp reversals after stop-loss triggers
  - High volume during the sweep
  - Institutional footprint visible

**Example**:
Gold trades at $1,920 with clear resistance at $1,925. Price quickly spikes to $1,927 (triggering stops), then reverses sharply to $1,918, indicating a liquidity sweep and potential short entry.

#### Order Blocks 🧱
- **Definition**:  
  Zones where significant institutional orders created strong directional movement. These areas often become key support/resistance levels on retests.

- **Identification Features**:
  - Last opposing candle before strong move
  - High volume at block formation
  - Clean departure from zone
  - Multiple retests respect the level

**Example**:
A bearish order block forms at $1,940 with strong selling pressure. Later retests of this level show repeated rejections, offering short opportunities with defined risk.
