# SPEC-1: Automated Trade Signal Bot using ICT Strategy

## Background

This project aims to develop an automated trade signal bot based on the Inner Circle Trader (ICT) strategy for the XAU/USD trading pair. The bot will focus on personal trading needs in the first phase, sending trade signals to a Telegram bot for review rather than executing trades directly.

The ICT strategy emphasizes technical analysis through market structure, liquidity zones, and time-based trading windows. In addition to these technical aspects, the bot will incorporate fundamental analysis by crawling forex news to assess potential macroeconomic impacts on trade decisions.

Key components include:
- Automated chart analysis to identify ICT trading setups such as liquidity grabs, fair value gaps, and order blocks.
- Crawling trusted forex news sources to integrate fundamental data into trade decision-making.
- Time-based trading windows to limit activity to specific high-probability periods.

## Requirements

The system must satisfy the following requirements to achieve the outlined objectives. These are prioritized using the MoSCoW framework:

### Must-Have
- Perform automated technical analysis based on ICT strategy concepts (e.g., liquidity zones, order blocks, fair value gaps).
- Integrate a Telegram bot to send trade signals with actionable information (e.g., entry points, stop loss, and take profit levels).
- Crawl reliable forex news sources to analyze economic events affecting XAU/USD.
- Operate within defined time-based trading windows (e.g., London and New York sessions).

### Should-Have
- Support multiple chart timeframes for ICT strategy application (e.g., 1M, 15M, 1H).
- Provide summarized trade rationale (e.g., "Liquidity grab near key resistance").
- Automatically adjust for Daylight Saving Time for accurate session windows.

### Could-Have
- Basic backtesting capabilities to simulate trades based on historical data.
- User-configurable thresholds for news impact analysis (e.g., ignore low-impact news).

### Won't-Have (for Phase 1)
- Fully automated trade execution.
- Multi-pair trading capability (focus is on XAU/USD).

## Method

### Architecture Design

The system architecture comprises three main components:
1. **Chart Analyzer**: Implements ICT strategy to identify trading signals.
2. **News Crawler**: Gathers and processes fundamental news data.
3. **Telegram Bot**: Sends trade signals and rationale to the user.

ICT Strategy Engine

The ICT Strategy Engine will identify trade setups using the following steps:
	1.	Market Structure Analysis:
	‚Ä¢	Detect higher highs (HH), lower lows (LL), and consolidation zones to determine trend direction.
	‚Ä¢	Algorithm: Use a sliding window approach to compare recent price points for trend formation.
	2.	Liquidity Zone Identification:
	‚Ä¢	Find price levels with visible stop-loss clusters or potential liquidity pools.
	‚Ä¢	Algorithm: Identify recent highs/lows and overlay historical volume data (if available).
	3.	Fair Value Gap (FVG) Detection:
	‚Ä¢	Identify imbalances between buying and selling pressure in candlesticks.
	‚Ä¢	Algorithm: Scan candlesticks for large wicks and gaps to mark FVG zones.
	4.	Time-Based Filtering:
	‚Ä¢	Trigger analysis during specified trading sessions only (e.g., London/NY session).
	‚Ä¢	Implementation: Python‚Äôs schedule library or a similar cron-based scheduler.

Output: A potential trade signal with the following details:
	‚Ä¢	Entry Point
	‚Ä¢	Stop Loss
	‚Ä¢	Take Profit

News Crawler

The News Crawler will enhance decisions by scoring news events:
	1.	Source Integration:
	‚Ä¢	Pull news data from APIs such as NewsAPI or RSS feeds from sites like ForexFactory.
	‚Ä¢	Implementation: Use Python‚Äôs requests library for API calls and BeautifulSoup for web scraping.
	2.	Sentiment Scoring:
	‚Ä¢	Keywords (e.g., ‚Äúhawkish,‚Äù ‚Äúdovish‚Äù) and impact levels (high/medium/low).
	‚Ä¢	Implementation: Natural language processing (NLP) using libraries like TextBlob or NLTK.
	3.	Output:
	‚Ä¢	News Impact Score: A numerical value indicating potential volatility.

Telegram Bot

The Telegram Bot will deliver actionable trade signals:
	1.	Signal Formatter:
	‚Ä¢	Format signals as a text message, including:
	‚Ä¢	Market condition: ‚ÄúBullish structure, liquidity grab detected.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Trade details: Entry/SL/TP prices.
	‚Ä¢	News Impact Score: ‚ÄúHigh volatility expected due to hawkish Fed speech.‚Äù
	2.	Message Sender:
	‚Ä¢	Connect to Telegram via python-telegram-bot or similar library.

Example Output:

üîî *Trade Signal - XAU/USD* üîî  
- Entry: 1925.30  
- SL: 1918.00  
- TP: 1940.50  
- Rationale: Liquidity grab above resistance, bullish order block confirmed.  
- News Impact: Medium (FOMC Minutes scheduled in 2 hours).  

Implementation

	1.	Set up infrastructure:
	‚Ä¢	Install libraries: schedule, python-telegram-bot, requests, and TextBlob.
	‚Ä¢	Connect to a charting API (e.g., MetaTrader or TradingView).
	2.	Develop core modules:
	‚Ä¢	Implement the ICT Strategy Engine.
	‚Ä¢	Build the News Crawler with sentiment analysis.
	3.	Integrate Telegram Bot:
	‚Ä¢	Format and send trade signals via Telegram.
	4.	Test the bot:
	‚Ä¢	Validate ICT algorithms with historical data.
	‚Ä¢	Simulate trade signal accuracy and news correlation.
	5.	Deploy the bot:
	‚Ä¢	Run on a cloud platform or personal server.

Milestones

	1.	Week 1: Set up libraries and APIs.
	2.	Week 2-3: Develop and test the ICT Strategy Engine.
	3.	Week 4: Build and test the News Crawler.
	4.	Week 5: Integrate and test Telegram Bot.
	5.	Week 6: Final testing and deployment.

Gathering Results

	1.	Compare generated signals with actual market movements.
	2.	Evaluate sentiment analysis impact on decision accuracy.
	3.	Collect feedback on Telegram signal clarity and responsiveness.
	4.	Adjust parameters for improved performance.
